 Install XUbuntu 20 from the following link:

https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/xubuntu-20-04-focal-fossa-l4t-r32-3-1-custom-image-for-the-jetson-nano/121768

Flash the image on the SD card from balenaEtcher:

https://www.balena.io/etcher/
 - Extract the zip file you have downloaded and open XUbuntu and write the following commands to extract Xubutun image:

tar -xvjf Xubuntu-20.04-l4t-r32.3.1.tar.tbz2

open the program and select the image, then select the device port name.

*Notes: The flashing takes long time up to 30 minutes.

Once the XUbuntu image is loaded, open the terminal to write the ROS 2 installation commands.
Get the commands from here: https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html

or simply copy/paste from the following:
1 - Set Locale:
locale
sudo apt update && sudo apt install locales
sudo locale-gen en_US en_US.UTF-8
sudo update-locale LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 LANG=en_US.UTF-8
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
locale
2 - Setup Sources:
apt-cache policy | grep universe or

sudo apt install software-properties-common

sudo add-apt-repository universe

sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl gnupg2 lsb-release

sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key -o /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg

echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(source /etc/os-release && echo $UBUNTU_CODENAME) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list > /dev/null

3 - Installing ROS packages:
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install ros-foxy-desktop
sudo apt install ros-foxy-ros-base
4 - Environment Setup:
source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
Now you are done installing ROS2, try to write command:

ROS2 topic list
and you'll see the default two topics indicating that ros is successfully running.
